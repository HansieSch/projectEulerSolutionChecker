Project Euler Solution Checker
==============================

Please note that this project currently can only check solutions for problems 1 to 50. Since those are the only ones I've solved and I have no desire to spoil the fun for myself by researching the other problems' solutions.

The solutions are stored as hashes to prevent users from submitting answers to problems they haven't solved themselves.

In the future I'd like to make this solution checker available for use offline.

## Run server - index.js
Used primarily to serve the solutions to the client.

Run as follows:
    
    node index.js
